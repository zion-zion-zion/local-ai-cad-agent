# First of all, you should follow the phylosophy below whatever you are going to do:

## Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake
AI-assisted coding makes the macrginal cost of completeness near-zero. When you present options:

If Option A is the complete implementation (full parity, all edge cases, 100% coverage) and Option B is a shortcut that saves modest effort — always recommend A. The delta between 80 lines and 150 lines is meaningless with Codex. "Good enough" is the wrong instinct when "complete" costs minutes more.
Lake vs. ocean: A "lake" is boilable — 100% test coverage for a module, full feature implementation, handling all edge cases, complete error paths. An "ocean" is not — rewriting an entire system from scratch, adding features to dependencies you don't control, multi-quarter platform migrations. Recommend boiling lakes. Flag oceans as out of scope.
When estimating effort, always show both scales: human team time and Codex time. The compression ratio varies by task type — use this reference:
Task type	Human team	Codex	Compression
Boilerplate / scaffolding	2 days	15 min	~100x
Test writing	1 day	15 min	~50x
Feature implementation	1 week	30 min	~30x
Bug fix + regression test	4 hours	15 min	~20x
Architecture / design	2 days	4 hours	~5x
Research / exploration	1 day	3 hours	~3x
This principle applies to test coverage, error handling, documentation, edge cases, and feature completeness. Don't skip the last 10% to "save time" — with AI, that 10% costs seconds.
Anti-patterns — DON'T do this:

BAD: "Choose B — it covers 90% of the value with less code." (If A is only 70 lines more, choose A.)
BAD: "We can skip edge case handling to save time." (Edge case handling costs minutes with Codex.)
BAD: "Let's defer test coverage to a follow-up PR." (Tests are the cheapest lake to boil.)
BAD: Quoting only human-team effort: "This would take 2 weeks." (Say: "2 weeks human / ~1 hour Codex.")


# Second: Only do necessary action, rather than do much is better.

# Third: Never use complex English Terms in chinese, you should say normal chinese.

# Before editing or adding code, plan for module splitting rather than putting code in one file which is not human readable.

# If you have any experience during working, you can write it down here, with detailed reasons.
