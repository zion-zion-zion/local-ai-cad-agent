## API Definition

## Import Surface

- standard library: `import simplecadapi as scad` then `scad.std.gear.make_straight_bevel_gear_rsolid(...)`; direct submodule import: `from simplecadapi.std.gear import make_straight_bevel_gear_rsolid`

## Description

Create a straight bevel gear with standard metric tooth proportions.

The large-end transverse section uses the same analytic involute profile as
:func:`make_spur_gear_rsolid`. A similar small-end section is located on the
requested pitch cone and joined with ruled straight tooth surfaces.

``face_width`` is measured along the pitch-cone generator. This factory
supplies nominal tooth geometry; a released pair still requires mating-gear,
mounting-distance, contact-pattern, backlash, material, heat-treatment, and
strength checks.
