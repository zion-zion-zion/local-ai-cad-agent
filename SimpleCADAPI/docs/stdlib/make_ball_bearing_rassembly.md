## Import Surface

- standard library: `import simplecadapi as scad` then `scad.std.bearing.make_ball_bearing_rassembly(...)`; direct submodule import: `from simplecadapi.std.bearing import make_ball_bearing_rassembly`

## Description

Create a parameterized radial ball bearing assembly.

With ``fuse_rolling_elements=False`` the factory returns separate
``outer_ring``, ``inner_ring``, and ``ball_*`` components.  With
``fuse_rolling_elements=True`` all rolling elements are translated to
their authored pitch positions and unioned into the outer-ring body using
normal boolean mode (``glue=False``).  The fused mode is intended for
simplified solver or export bodies; it deliberately embeds the balls into
the outer-race inner wall and therefore does not preserve the nominal
raceway clearance as a free gap.

``material`` is assigned to the generated ring and rolling-element parts.
